**Senior Software Developer**


I received my PhD from the University of Vienna (2022, [thesis](https://utheses.univie.ac.at/detail/62431)).
I was honored to be a member of the research group [Communication Technologies](https://ct.cs.univie.ac.at/team/person/102452/) led by [Prof. Stefan Schmid](https://schmiste.github.io/).
My research involved solving optimization problems around software-defined networking and network function virtualization concepts.
I'm interested in applied research and/or development opportunities in English-speaking companies.

## Some More

- I started with programming out of passion in high school and got first commercial job in 2004 during bachelor studies in Tehran.
- Had my first working experience abroad in a Berlin startup 2013, [Doc Cirrus GmbH](https://www.doc-cirrus.com) (2013--2015) as a backend developer.
- During the Berlin life, I was fancying doing a PhD in CS and finally did it in 2022 in Wien.
- I'm familiar with modern C++, Java, Javascript, Python, Bash,...
- I'd like to be involved in challenging problem solving activies that keep me away from the mundanes of daily life. I'm pretty much flexible in picking up new technologies and scientific fields as work demands.
